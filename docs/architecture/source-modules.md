# Source module boundaries

Spine uses ordinary C translation units grouped by responsibility. Module
headers stay beside their implementations;
`*_internal.h` headers describe only collaboration inside the implementation.
There are no implementation-file includes in production. Include-based legacy
unit tests retain their syscall interception by including the moved sources.

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/` | Application entry, CLI, startup, process-wide runtime ownership and shutdown |
| `src/config/` | Configuration models, defaults, settings cache, database-backed options and file parsing |
| `src/database/` | Connections, pools, Cacti query construction, result/host persistence and remote synchronization |
| `src/ping/` | Address parsing, UDP/TCP probes, IPv4/IPv6 ICMP, shared raw-socket reply dispatch |
| `src/poller/` | Cycle coordination, workers, hosts, availability combinations, reindexing, item batches and numerical results |
| `src/script/` | External scripts, PHP server lifecycle, protocol framing and response reading |
| `src/process/` | Pipes, spawning, child ownership and bounded reaping |
| `src/platform/` | Clocks, socket readiness, descriptors, OS privileges, threads and synchronization |
| `src/log/` | Logging, formatting and sanitization |
| `src/snmp/` | Sessions, requests, responses and security-protocol selection |

Entry points and subsystem coordinators live alongside their modules in `src/`.
`app/main.c` contains only the executable entry point; `app/runtime.c` owns
process initialization and shutdown through `spine_run()`. Linked regression
and fault tests use the same runtime object files as the production executable,
with their own entry points. They exercise runtime exit paths in child processes.
Automake source groups are shared by production and linked tests. The fuzz
build includes the shared runtime sources used by its targets. Autotools remains
the build system.

The split keeps the original function bodies and public signatures. Private
helpers that collaborate across translation units have declarations in internal
headers; helpers used by only one translation unit retain static linkage.
Shared ICMP state remains protected by LOCK_ICMP, including registration,
reply dispatch and ownership handoff. Worker accounting, SQL retry budgets,
script framing, result ownership and shutdown sequencing are unchanged.

At extraction, all 308 original root-source function bodies matched a lexical
comparison with the new module set. Compiler/linker checks and existing runtime
contracts provide the behavior validation; a text comparison alone is not a
runtime acceptance test. Production files range up to approximately 680 lines,
with most below 500. Tests and historical fixtures are separate from that count.

The responsibility-layout follow-up preserves all 330 existing function bodies
in a lexical comparison, including the executable body now named `spine_run`.
The former `util.c` is replaced by focused buffer, clock, readiness, descriptor,
thread, configuration-text, script-escaping and logging interfaces. Configuration
models and numerical-result types have dedicated headers. Cacti query builders
and persistence routines reside in `database/`; availability policy stays in
`poller/`, separate from probe transports. Headers document borrowed handles,
returned allocations, errors and synchronization where these interfaces cross
module boundaries. Broad compatibility headers remain during incremental
migration; this is not a complete removal of shared runtime state.

## Repository conventions

`include/spine/` is reserved for deliberately supported external interfaces.
No external SDK is currently installed. The legacy compatibility headers in
`src/internal/` retain shared definitions while focused interfaces replace them.
Private `*_internal.h` headers stay beside the subsystem they serve. The vendored
uthash header lives under `vendor/uthash/` and remains byte-identical.

`etc/spine.conf.dist` supplies the installed configuration template, and
`docs/man/spine.1` supplies the manual. Installation paths and executable names
are unchanged. Contract tests live under `tests/contracts/`; the regression and
fault-test entry points live under `tests/regression/`.

The root keeps Autotools entry points, the default Dockerfile and conventional
project documents. Development/coverage Dockerfiles live under `docker/`, release
helpers under `scripts/`, and platform packaging under `packaging/`. GitHub
workflows, actions, templates and review-routing files live under `.github/`.
Autotools' generated `config/` directory is distinct from the tracked `etc/` tree.
